# Small Tables Auto Exemption Implementation Journal

**Scenario**: Tables under 1GB are automatically exempted from clustering requirements
**Start Date**: 2025-01-31
**Status**: Research

## Implementation Timeline

### Research Phase (2025-01-31)
- [x] **Feasibility confirmed**: Can Databricks create objects that violate the rule?
  - Yes, tables of any size can exist without clustering
- [x] **SDK research complete**: How to access required data structures?
  - Use DESCRIBE DETAIL SQL command via Statement Execution API
  - sizeInBytes field provides table size information
- [x] **Configuration identified**: What configuration values are needed?
  - Already configured: size_threshold_bytes: 1073741824 (1GB)
  - Already configured: exempt_small_tables: true
- [x] **Test scenarios validated**: Can we create test conditions for validation?
  - Can create tables of various sizes with and without clustering

**Research artifacts**: See `research/clustering/small_tables_auto_exemption/`

### Layer 1: Unit Tests (2025-01-31)
- [x] **Validator methods implemented**: 
  - get_table_size_bytes() - SQL-based size detection via DESCRIBE DETAIL
  - is_small_table() - threshold-based size checking (1GB/1MB for test tables)  
  - Extended is_exempt_from_clustering_requirements() - combined manual + size exemption
  - Updated should_enforce_clustering_requirements() - inverse of exemption logic
- [x] **Unit tests created**: 25 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
  - Size thresholds, test table thresholds, manual exclusion precedence
  - Configuration disable, edge cases, parametrized testing
- [x] **Makefile integration**: Added small-tables-auto-exemption to SCENARIOS list and unit test mapping
- [x] **Quality checks**: All tests pass (25/25), all linting and mypy checks pass
- [ ] **ðŸ”„ PHILOSOPHY CHECK COMPLETED**: Added Layer 1 entry to IMPLEMENTATION_JOURNAL.md with learnings and recommendations

**Validation**: `make test-scenario SCENARIO=small-tables-auto-exemption LAYER=unit` â†’ 25 tests pass

### Layer 2: Integration Tests ([Date])
- [ ] **Test table specifications**: Added to table factory for scenario testing
- [ ] **Integration test file**: Created `test_[scenario_name]_integration.py`
- [ ] **Real Databricks validation**: Test against actual tables
- [ ] **ðŸ”„ PHILOSOPHY CHECK COMPLETED**: Added Layer 2 entry to IMPLEMENTATION_JOURNAL.md with learnings and recommendations

**Validation**: `make test-scenario SCENARIO=[scenario-name] LAYER=integration` â†’ X tests pass

### Layer 3: Production Tests ([Date])
- [ ] **BDD step definitions**: Updated documentation_steps.py
- [ ] **Feature file update**: Added scenario to .feature file
- [ ] **ðŸ”„ PHILOSOPHY CHECK COMPLETED**: Added Layer 3 entry to IMPLEMENTATION_JOURNAL.md with production insights and final assessment  
- [ ] **Production data testing**: Test against real workspace tables

**Validation**: `make test-scenario SCENARIO=[scenario-name] LAYER=production` â†’ Tests execute successfully

## Key Technical Decisions

### [Decision Area 1]
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Rationale**: Why was this approach chosen?
- **Impact**: What code/architecture was affected?
- **Alternatives considered**: What other options were evaluated?

### [Decision Area 2]
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Rationale**: Why was this approach chosen?
- **Impact**: What code/architecture was affected?
- **Configuration**: How is this configurable?

## Philosophy Check Results

### After Layer 1
