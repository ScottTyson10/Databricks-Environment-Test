# [SCENARIO_NAME] Implementation Journal

**Scenario**: [Brief description of what this scenario validates]
**Start Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: [Research/Layer 1/Layer 2/Layer 3/Complete]

## Implementation Timeline

### Research Phase ([Date])
- [ ] **Feasibility confirmed**: Can Databricks create objects that violate the rule?
- [ ] **SDK research complete**: How to access required data structures?
- [ ] **Configuration identified**: What configuration values are needed?
- [ ] **Test scenarios validated**: Can we create test conditions for validation?

**Research artifacts**: See `research/[feature_area]/[scenario_name]/`

### Layer 1: Unit Tests ([Date])
- [ ] **Validator methods implemented**: List key methods added to DocumentationValidator
- [ ] **Unit tests created**: Number of tests and coverage areas
- [ ] **Makefile integration**: Added scenario to SCENARIOS list and unit test mapping
- [ ] **Quality checks**: All tests pass, code quality validated

**Validation**: `make test-scenario SCENARIO=[scenario-name] LAYER=unit` → X tests pass

### Layer 2: Integration Tests ([Date])
- [ ] **Test table specifications**: Added to table factory for scenario testing
- [ ] **Integration test file**: Created `test_[scenario_name]_integration.py`
- [ ] **Real Databricks validation**: Test against actual tables

**Validation**: `make test-scenario SCENARIO=[scenario-name] LAYER=integration` → X tests pass

### Layer 3: Production Tests ([Date])
- [ ] **BDD step definitions**: Updated documentation_steps.py
- [ ] **Feature file update**: Added scenario to .feature file  
- [ ] **Production data testing**: Test against real workspace tables

**Validation**: `make test-scenario SCENARIO=[scenario-name] LAYER=production` → Tests execute successfully

## Key Technical Decisions

### [Decision Area 1]
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Rationale**: Why was this approach chosen?
- **Impact**: What code/architecture was affected?
- **Alternatives considered**: What other options were evaluated?

### [Decision Area 2]
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Rationale**: Why was this approach chosen?
- **Impact**: What code/architecture was affected?
- **Configuration**: How is this configurable?

## Philosophy Check Results

### After Layer 1
- [ ] **Architecture compliance**: Unit tests have no external dependencies
- [ ] **Test coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of validation logic
- [ ] **Performance**: Fast execution time
- [ ] **Quality**: All code quality checks pass
- [ ] **Integration ready**: Makefile integration working

**Issues found**: None / List any issues and resolutions

### After Layer 2
- [ ] **Real data validation**: Integration tests work with actual Databricks tables
- [ ] **Test reliability**: Tests pass consistently and clean up properly
- [ ] **Performance**: Integration tests complete in reasonable time
- [ ] **Coverage**: All test scenarios properly validated

**Issues found**: None / List any issues and resolutions

### After Layer 3
- [ ] **Production readiness**: BDD scenarios execute against real data
- [ ] **Business value**: Scenarios provide meaningful compliance insights
- [ ] **Error handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures
- [ ] **Documentation**: All implementation properly documented

**Issues found**: None / List any issues and resolutions
